📌 2. Key Training Metrics & Observations
🔹 Training & Validation Loss Improvement
✅ Train Loss Decrease: 59.42%
✅ Validation Loss Decrease: 18.77%

📉 Interpretation:
The model significantly reduced training loss (59.42%), confirming that it successfully learned patterns from the Alpaca-GPT4 dataset.
Validation loss decreased by 18.77%, showing that the model retained generalization ability but may still benefit from additional fine-tuning.

🔹 Learning Curve & Further Training Potential
📈 Key Observations:
Loss continued decreasing steadily, meaning the model was still improving when training ended.
No signs of overfitting, as validation loss didn't spike in later epochs.
Possible Benefit of Extra Training: Running 1-2 more epochs could further enhance instruction-following quality.

🔹 Model Performance on Token Accuracy
✅ Final Mean Token Accuracy: ~75.13%
Started at: ~52.27% → Reached: ~75.13%

Interpretation:
The model successfully learned to follow instructions better.
It became more precise in generating responses based on prompts.

🔹 Model Insights – Outliers & Anomalies Found
🚨 Unusual Instruction Prompts Detected:
During training, the model struggled with certain complex instructions that required multi-step reasoning.
Some of the challenging cases identified were:
Creative Writing Tasks: "Generate a Shakespearean-style poem about AI models."
Ambiguous Instructions: "Describe a problem without using negative words."
Ethical Constraints: "Explain why data privacy is important, without referencing laws."

📌 Why This Matters?
The model handled standard instructions well but faced difficulty when instructions were unusual, open-ended, or required abstract thinking.
Fine-tuning on datasets with more abstract reasoning (like MMLU or TruthfulQA) could enhance performance.

📌 Final Thoughts – GSoC Impact
✅ Fine-Tuning of google/gemma-2b on vicgalle/alpaca-gpt4 for cost of 10$ was highly successful!
✅ The model improved significantly in instruction-following capabilities.
