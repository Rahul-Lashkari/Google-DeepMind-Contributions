"A bus travels at 50 miles per hour. How far does it go in 3.5 hours?"
Error: Incorrect multiplication of time.

2️⃣ Word Problem Misinterpretations:
Some misreadings of question intent caused incorrect responses.
Example:
"A farmer plants 3 rows of corn, each with 6 plants. How many total plants?"
Error: Misinterpretation of multiplication requirement.
